## Title
<span style="color:blue">*__Sinuous__*</span>
## Description
### User
<span style="color:orange">There is a **pilot** that is represented on the home screen by a **blue orb** with a floating tail. It **follows your mouse**, and there is a **live counter** on it. There are red balls on the home screen. It is the user's job to avoid such balls. If the pilot **touches** a ball, it **loses** a live, which is represented by a decrease on the pilot's live counter. As the user progresses, the game gets faster and harder. **Power ups** are available to make the user slower relative to the balls and to make the user invincible.</span>

### Functionality
<span style="color:blue">**Four** class files exist. A **pilot**, an **enemy**, and **powerups**. Each of these interact with the other, but the main difference is that only **one** pilot is instantiated, while **many** enemies, and fewer powerups, are instantiated. Furthermore, enemies continuously spawn from **one** direction, in a seemingly infinite manner until the pilot loses lives. The **illusion** of movement is created by the **velocity** of the balls; the more the balls move and the faster they move, the more it appears that the pilot moves around them, the tail of the pilot following. Lives of the pilot are controlled by a stack that pushes and pops as permissible, and powerups are controlled by a stack that pushes and pops randomly. Enemies are spawned **continuously** until the pilot dies. User customizability (pilot color, enemy color, etc.) will be availabe after the game's base is finished. There are game states that are based upon key presses, (**'g'** for run game, **'p'** for pause).</span>
